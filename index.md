## Description

The Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life (ERA) is the official student, post-doc, and junior researcher group for the [International Society for Artificial Life (ISAL)](http://alife.org/).
The purpose of the ISAL student group is to provide opportunities for students and post-docs interested in artificial life to interact with each other, develop professionally, and contribute to the broader artificial life community.

This workshop will be held as part of the (virtual) [2020 Conference on Artificial Life](http://2020.alife.org/).
The goal of this workshop is to provide a venue for junior researchers to meet, share their work, and network.

We will begin with a brief informational discussion about ERA, including an introduction by the current elected chairs, an overview on how to get involved in the group, discussions of events and activities junior researchers would like to see organized by the group, and a request for nominations for 2020-2021 ERA chairs.
Additionally, we will announce any upcoming ERA-organized social events planned during the conference. Following this general discussion, we will highlight the recipient of the 2020 ISAL Outstanding Student Paper Award, inviting them to present their work.

To give junior ALife researchers a minimal-barrier-to-entry venue to share their research with peers, we will offer sign-ups to give lightning talks on research at any stage of development, ranging from rough ideas for future projects to already published work. This style of lightning talks for students was successful at the 2017 European Conference on Artificial Life. The workshop will conclude with ALife-themed academic karaoke, an entertaining social activity where participants present an unknown (to the presenter) series of ALife-themed slides.

After the workshop, we will compose a brief summary of the general meeting and contributed talks (in collaboration with interested participants) to be made publicly available here.

## Sign up for a research lightning talk or to participate in academic karaoke!

**Sign up for a lightning talk slot and/or to participate in academic karaoke by emailing us at
lalejini@msu.edu or by making a pull request on this [website's GitHub repository](https://github.com/amlalejini/ALife-2020--Emerging-Researchers-in-ALife-Workshop).**

You do not need to commit to a topic for your lightning talk in order to sign up for a speaking slot.
We don't need to know your topic until you present!
If you do know what you'd like to talk about, however, we'll post the topic/description here.

We will have time for roughly 10 speaking slots for both lightning talks and academic karaoke (allocation will depend on interest).
Sign-ups are first-come, first-serve, so feel free to sign up as early as you'd like!
We will be soliciting sign-ups (until full) up until the time of the workshop.

If you have any questions feel free to email us (or, file [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/amlalejini/ALife-2020--Emerging-Researchers-in-ALife-Workshop/issues) if that's your jam).
