## Description

The Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life (ERA) is the official student, post-doc, and junior researcher group for the [International Society for Artificial Life (ISAL)](http://alife.org/).
The purpose of the ISAL student group is to provide opportunities for students and post-docs interested in artificial life to interact with each other, develop professionally, and contribute to the broader artificial life community.

This workshop will be held as part of the [2023 Conference on Artificial Life](http://2023.alife.org/).
The workshop will be hybrid, supporting both those attending the conference virtually and those physically in Japan.
The goal of this workshop is to provide a venue for junior researchers to meet, share their work, and network.

## Schedule

- **General information about the ERA** (15-20 minutes)
  - We will begin with a brief informational discussion about ERA, including an introduction by the current elected chairs, an overview on how to get involved in the group, discussions of events and activities junior researchers would like to see organized by the group, and a request for nominations for 2023-2024 ERA chairs.
  - Additionally, we will announce any upcoming ERA-organized social events planned during the conference.
- **Announcement of the 2023 Outstanding Student Paper Award recipient** (5 minutes)
- **A look into the ALife Career of Olaf Witkowski** (15 minutes + questions)
- **Research lightning talks** (35 minutes, 7 minutes each)
  - To give junior ALife researchers a minimal-barrier-to-entry venue to share their research with peers, we are offering sign-ups to give lightning talks on research at any stage of development, ranging from rough ideas for future projects to already published work.
  - [**Sign up for a lightning talk slot below**](#sign-up-for-a-research-lightning-talk-or-to-participate-in-academic-karaoke)
- **Academic karaoke** (15-??? minutes, 5 minutes each)
  - Academic karaoke is an entertaining improvisational social activity where participants present a series of ALife-themed slides that they have never seen before! The presenter's goal is to give an improvisational talk on-the-fly. We've held academic karaoke the last three years, and each year had hilarious talks and lots of laughter!

## Sign up for a research lightning talk or to participate in academic karaoke!

**Sign up for a lightning talk slot and/or to participate in academic karaoke by emailing us at emerging.researchers.alife@gmail.com or reaching out to us on the Discord!**

You do not need to commit to a topic for your lightning talk in order to sign up for a speaking slot.
We don't need to know your topic until you present!
If you do know what you'd like to talk about, however, we'll post the topic/description here.

We should have time for roughly 10 speaking slots split between lightning talks and academic karaoke (allocation depending on interest).
Sign-ups are first-come, first-serve, so feel free to sign up as early as you'd like!
We will be accepting sign-ups up until the time of the workshop or until all slots have been filled.
